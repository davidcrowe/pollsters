## Far Vision

Vote with privacy and transparency


## Near Vision

Ensure a fully verifiable voting system with no privacy breach for the voters.


## Product Summary

A significant number of voters, candidates and technology experts believe that the online voting system is not trustworthy enough. Stanford professor David Hill published an article about online voting. One of the many issues he triggered is the possibility of manipulation done by the application’s business logic itself. Link to the article:

[David Dill: Why Online Voting Is a Danger to Democracy | Stanford School of Engineering](https://engineering.stanford.edu/magazine/article/david-dill-why-online-voting-danger-democracy) 

The Guardian reports that “_[Harvard cyber law study into Swiss e-voting trials](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/sites/cyber.law.harvard.edu/files/Gerlach-Gasser_SwissCases_Evoting.pdf)_ echoed that, noting that, aside from malware and related threats, e-voting systems need to be secured against vote manipulation.” Source: [Gerlach-Gasser_SwissCases_Evoting.pdf (harvard.edu)](https://cyber.harvard.edu/sites/cyber.law.harvard.edu/files/Gerlach-Gasser_SwissCases_Evoting.pdf)

This lack of trust in the online voting system could be wiped out if the system produces a ‘hard copy’ of voting details for audit purposes. Each of the voters can then verify their own vote by looking into the publicly available voting details. However this solution invites another problem with privacy requirements. Voters need to keep their votes confidential.

‘Vote Cast’ webapp will solve this confidentiality issue by generating a privacy code for each voter. Only the voter will know his own privacy code. The voter will cast his vote using that privacy code. ‘Vote Cast’ system will publish the voting details publicly in hard copy after the voting time is over. This copy will show who has voted for whom. **This will not show the voter’s name on it, but the privacy code. **Voter’s privacy code should start with page number of the published hard copy. That will make it easy for a voter to go back to the audit copy and verify his vote by himself.

## [Product Backlog](https://github.com/davidcrowe/pollsters/projects/1)


## Rationale for Product Backlog Prioritization

We prioritized our backlog based on what backlog items were most important to our ability to deliver a minimum viable product (MVP). We used this as our primary criteria given that the short semester will limit development time and we are focusing on developing an MVP. 


## Definition of Ready



*   Title: We have an easily understandable title.
*   User Story Opening Sentence: we have a concise user story statement.
*   Additional Details: We have taken into consideration any extra details.
*   Acceptance Criteria: We have added specific acceptance criteria (if applicable).
*   Estimated In Story Points: We can estimate each item with confidence.


## Whole Team Relative Estimate Sizing

Planning Poker



**Only Development Team Members participated in Product Backlog Items estimating.**

## Sprint 1


## Sprint forecast

12 story points


## Rationale for our sprint forecast

Each developer has the capacity to complete 4 story points during one sprint. So we have taken a total of 12 story points to complete.

**Only development team members pulled stories into the sprint backlog.**

## Evidence of Pair or Mob Programming
![Evidence of Mob Programming](https://github.com/davidcrowe/pollsters/blob/main/Evidence%20of%20Mob%20Programming.png)

## Evidence of Unit Testing 

We wrote 9 unit tests (4 in the back-end API application and 5 in the front-end UI application)  but we encountered an impediment that prevented us from running most of those tests. Specifically, we encountered versioning issues for Angular in local machines vs. code base. We have created a PBI with an acceptance criteria and estimated story points to resolve this impediment in the next sprint. In total, only 3 unit tests have passed.

## Sprint 2

**Sprint Planning**

We estimate that our development team has capacity to complete approximately 8 story points during this sprint that directly add value to stakeholders. Additionally, we estimate capacity to complete approximately 10 story points related to technical debt/environment setup tasks. Our rationale is twofold:



1. During spring 1, we completed 7 story points that directly delivered value to stakeholders. We think this is about right for sustainable development pace given the length of our sprints
2. During sprint 1, we completed 9 story points related to technical debt/environment setup tasks. We think this is about right for sustainable development pace given the length of our sprints, though we endeavor to reduce time spent on environment setup/technical debt so we can shift more time to user stories that deliver value to stakeholders

Upon determining our story point forecast, the development team met to pull the top user stories and a few high priority environmental setup tasks into our sprint backlog. Only development team members participated in this activity. We generated the following [Sprint Backlog](https://github.com/davidcrowe/pollsters/projects/3) with 19 story points:



* Build voter landing page view (3 story points)
* Allow voters to generate privacy code from within the app (5 story points)
* Implement CI/CD (8 story points)
* Fix Angular versioning issue (3 story points)

We decomposed the Spring Backlog into the developer tasks below. We came up with test cases specific to each task before beginning development:



* Create a landing page that is displayed to users upon logging into the app
* Add two buttons to the landing page: one to "generate privacy code" and the other to "proceed to ballot"
* When "generate privacy code" is clicked, generate and display a 16-digit alphanumeric code.

The [Sprint #2 burndown chart](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e0NPRbDEHEs83mi9ooCruVue1PZFC_L9l-14lYdib-Q/edit) shows our team's progress towards completing the sprint backlog.

## Evidence of Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery

We built a CI/CD pipeline using Github and Microsoft Azure. Specifically, we took the following actions: 1/ created an Azure DevOps project; 2/ created a new pipeline; 3/ Selected Github as our source control tool and authorized Azure to access it via OAuth; 4/ Built our pipeline including node.js tool installer & npm installers; 5/ set a trigger and enabled CI. 

Unfortunately we ran into a roadblock as Microsoft requires that we request access for pipelines for public repositories. Specifically, we received an error message: “No hosted parallelism has been purchased or granted. To request a free parallelism grant, please fill out the following form: [https://aka.ms/azpipelines-parallelism-request](https://aka.ms/azpipelines-parallelism-request)”. We expect to receive approval within two to three business days and our CI/CD pipeline will be available then.

## Evidence of Stakeholder Attendance

Our stakeholder Eashrak is a US citizen and voter. She is very active in politics. We asked her to select the best president of the USA ever. She is also a Software Developer and she has given some observations for the app.

## Sprint Review

Stakeholder comments:



* “I liked the straightforward UI”
* “I liked the unique voter ID code”
* “I wish the product was functional instead of hard-coded”
* “Excited to see the voting functionality in action”
* “I want to see confirmation that my vote has been recorded & confirmed”

Product Owner comments:



* “Great progress from the development team on implementing the landing page, security code functionality, and embracing unit tests and test driven development”
* “Ran into a roadblock for CI/CD and were unable to complete during the sprint. Therefore, we will add it back to the product backlog and the development team can decide to pull it into the next sprint at their prerogative”

## Sprint 3


## Sprint Planning

We estimate that our development team has capacity to complete approximately 11 story points during this sprint. During sprint #2, we included 19 story points in our sprint backlog, but only completed 11 story points. Therefore, the new sprint #3 estimate is based on “yesterday’s weather” as we estimate that we will be able to complete the same number of story points in sprint #3 as sprint #2.  

Upon determining our story point forecast, the development team met to pull user stories from the top of our product backlog into the sprint backlog. **Only development team members participated in this activity**. We added the following Product Backlog Items to Sprint Backlog for a total of 10 story points:



* As a voter, I want to be able to see the ballot so that I can accurately record my vote (8 story points)
* As a voter, I want confirmation that my vote has been processed after submitting my vote so that I can be confident that the vote was accurately recorded (2 story points)

We decomposed the Spring Backlog into the developer tasks below. We came up with test cases specific to each task before beginning development:



* Add a button for each candidate in the ballot that voters can click on to vote for that candidate
* Add a confirmation message to the ballot page when the voter clicks on the vote button.
* Add candidate information to the ballot including photo and name.

## Evidence of Pair or Mob Programming

![mob](https://github.com/davidcrowe/pollsters/blob/main/Sprint%203%20-%20Mob%20programming.png)

## Evidence of Unit Testing 

Our product has two applications. One is the backend API (https://**votecastapi**.azurewebsites.net) written on C#.NET, another application is the frontend (https://**votecast**.azurewebsites.net/) written in JavaScript using Angular framework. Total 20 unit tests are for JavaScript code which can be run without the presence of API and Database. There are 4 unit tests for API, which can be run solely on API code without having connected it to the database and frontend.In this sprint** total 10 new** unit test cases have been created before code development started. Each unit test covers one of the business requirements. We use JASMIN (BDD) and KARMA to write and run the test. TDD and BDD practices have been followed.

Below screenshot shows all JavaScript unit tests passed.

Below screenshot shows 3 out of 4 C# API unit tests passed. One has been skipped.

## Evidence of Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery

We built a fully working CI/CD pipeline using Github and Microsoft Azure DevOps. We have tested the pipeline via multiple code pushes to the main code branch and have confirmed that the pipeline works as intended.
