## Far Vision

Vote with privacy and transparency


## Near Vision

Ensure a fully verifiable voting system with no privacy breach for the voters.


## Product Summary

A significant number of voters, candidates and technology experts believe that the online voting system is not trustworthy enough. Stanford professor David Hill published an article about online voting. One of the many issues he triggered is the possibility of manipulation done by the application’s business logic itself. Link to the article:

[David Dill: Why Online Voting Is a Danger to Democracy | Stanford School of Engineering](https://engineering.stanford.edu/magazine/article/david-dill-why-online-voting-danger-democracy) 

The Guardian reports that “_[Harvard cyber law study into Swiss e-voting trials](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/sites/cyber.law.harvard.edu/files/Gerlach-Gasser_SwissCases_Evoting.pdf)_ echoed that, noting that, aside from malware and related threats, e-voting systems need to be secured against vote manipulation.” Source: [Gerlach-Gasser_SwissCases_Evoting.pdf (harvard.edu)](https://cyber.harvard.edu/sites/cyber.law.harvard.edu/files/Gerlach-Gasser_SwissCases_Evoting.pdf)

This lack of trust in the online voting system could be wiped out if the system produces a ‘hard copy’ of voting details for audit purposes. Each of the voters can then verify their own vote by looking into the publicly available voting details. However this solution invites another problem with privacy requirements. Voters need to keep their votes confidential.

‘Vote Cast’ webapp will solve this confidentiality issue by generating a privacy code for each voter. Only the voter will know his own privacy code. The voter will cast his vote using that privacy code. ‘Vote Cast’ system will publish the voting details publicly in hard copy after the voting time is over. This copy will show who has voted for whom. **This will not show the voter’s name on it, but the privacy code. **Voter’s privacy code should start with page number of the published hard copy. That will make it easy for a voter to go back to the audit copy and verify his vote by himself.

## [Product Backlog](https://github.com/davidcrowe/pollsters/projects/1)


## Rationale for Product Backlog Prioritization

We prioritized our backlog based on what backlog items were most important to our ability to deliver a minimum viable product (MVP). We used this as our primary criteria given that the short semester will limit development time and we are focusing on developing an MVP. 


## Definition of Ready



*   Title: We have an easily understandable title.
*   User Story Opening Sentence: we have a concise user story statement.
*   Additional Details: We have taken into consideration any extra details.
*   Acceptance Criteria: We have added specific acceptance criteria (if applicable).
*   Estimated In Story Points: We can estimate each item with confidence.
